- Discovery Mode (dialogic, Socratic questioning)
- Long-running (months), retired at major transitions

**TIER 2: Work Unit Chats**
- Specific deliverables with bounded scope
- Execution Mode (directive, efficient)
- Short-lived (days-weeks), retired when complete

**META Chat (Special)**
- Maintains Project Overview document
- Updated every 2-4 weeks
- Keeps all chats aligned on current status

### Key Protocols

- **Opening Protocol:** Orientation at start of every session
- **Closing Protocol:** Document accomplishments and next steps

## 🔬 Methodology Highlights

### Core Principles

1. **Transparency:** Full documentation of AI collaboration with contribution ratios
2. **Academic Integrity:** Clear boundaries between consultation and creation
3. **Progressive Autonomy:** Scaffolded support that builds independence
4. **Iterative Refinement:** System evolves through use, not perfect design
5. **Researcher Authority:** Human maintains intellectual ownership and final decisions

### What Makes This Different

- **Not just guidelines:** Complete working system with 11 sessions of proof
- **Action research approach:** Iterative cycles of plan-act-observe-reflect
- **Honest documentation:** Includes failures, adjustments, and complexity management
- **Living methodology:** Shows system evolution in real-time
- **Contribution transparency:** Every document marked with H/C ratio
