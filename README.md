# AI Collaboration System for Doctoral Research

A comprehensive framework for sustainable, long-term AI collaboration in academic research contexts, developed through iterative design and implementation in an EdD dissertation project.

## Overview

This system provides structured protocols for managing AI-human collaboration across 18+ month research timelines, balancing efficiency with methodological rigor. It addresses common challenges in sustained AI use: scope creep, context loss, resource management, and academic integrity documentation.

**Key Features:**
- Two-tier chat architecture (Home Base + Work Units)
- Communication mode protocols (Discovery vs. Execution)
- Systematic naming conventions for chats, artifacts, and files
- Project Overview maintenance system
- Token monitoring and chat retirement protocols
- Contribution tracking for academic transparency
- Complete implementation guide with troubleshooting

## System Requirements

**Designed for:**
- Claude Pro, Teams, or Enterprise accounts
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)
- Projects with persistent file storage and custom instructions

**May be adaptable to other AI platforms, but functionality depends on similar capabilities.**

## Quick Start

1. **Read the [Comprehensive Reference Guide](2025-11-07_META_AI-Collaboration-Reference-Guide_H50-C50_v1.0.md)** - Complete documentation with implementation steps
2. **Configure Account-Level Settings** - Universal collaboration protocols
3. **Set Up Project Structure** - Instructions, files, and chat architecture
4. **Generate Initial Project Overview** - Baseline context document
5. **Create Home Base Chat** - Begin sustainable collaboration

Full step-by-step instructions in Implementation Guide (Section 11 of Reference Guide).

## Who This Is For

**Primary Audience:**
- Doctoral students conducting long-term research
- Researchers using AI for data analysis, literature review, or writing
- Academics interested in transparent AI collaboration methodology

**Also Useful For:**
- Professional researchers managing complex projects
- Anyone seeking structured approaches to sustained AI use
- Methodologists examining AI-human collaboration practices

## Key Principles

### Discovery vs. Execution Modes
- **Discovery:** Exploratory dialogue for developing thinking
- **Execution:** Directive guidance for efficient implementation
- Clear mode switching prevents resource waste

### Progressive Autonomy
- System supports evolving collaboration patterns
- Scaffolds independence rather than creating dependency
- Strategic delegation based on capability development

### Transparent Documentation
- Contribution ratios track human/AI work (H[X]-C[Y] format)
- Academic integrity through clear attribution
- Methodological transparency for research validity

### Resource Management
- Proactive token monitoring prevents disruption
- Strategic chat retirement at natural breakpoints
- Lean file structures optimize performance

## Use Cases

**This system is actively used for:**
- EdD dissertation research (action research methodology)
- Qualitative data analysis and coding
- Theoretical framework synthesis
- Literature review organization
- Academic writing and editing
- Research tool development

**Adaptable to:**
- Mixed methods research
- Quantitative analysis support
- Grant writing and project management
- Course development and teaching materials
- Professional writing projects

## Research Context

This system was developed as part of an EdD dissertation examining AI-human collaboration in doctoral research at Northeastern University's Graduate School of Education. It represents an action research approach to designing sustainable protocols for academic AI use.
