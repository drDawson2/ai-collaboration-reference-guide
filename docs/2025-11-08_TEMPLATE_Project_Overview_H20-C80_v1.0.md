## Template Usage Instructions (For META Chat)

When updating the Project Overview in META chat:

1. **Review** the current `Project Overview - Current.md` for existing content
2. **Reference** this template for proper structure and sections
3. **Incorporate** David's updates and recent developments
4. **Maintain** the same section structure and formatting
5. **Update** the "Date Last Updated" field
6. **Keep concise** - optimize for AI consumption, not exhaustive detail
7. **Focus** on what's currently active and relevant

**Quality checks:**

- Is each active chat clearly listed with its file routing?
- Are recently completed chats acknowledged?
- Is timeline context current and accurate?
- Are key decisions/frameworks documented?
- Is the file inventory up to date?
- Is the artifacts inventory current with versions and contribution ratios?

**Optimization principle:** The Overview should enable any chat in the project to orient quickly without requiring extensive context re-explanation from David.
